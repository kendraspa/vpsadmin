Dataset destroyal may have several steps, depending on the role the pool it is in has.

# Destroying datasets in `primary` or `hypervisor` pool
Dataset is destroyed immediately, including all its descendants. Its respective
backup datasets are not. Backup datasets of the destroyed dataset and all its
descendants are marked for deletion, expiration is set and they are destroyed
with all their snapshots after the expiration date.

# Destroying datasets in `backup` pool
Backup datasets are destroyed immediately, if their primary counterparts are kept.
