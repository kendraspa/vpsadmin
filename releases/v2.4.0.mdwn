# Release notes
Version 2.4 brings support for multilingual e-mails sent by vpsAdmin. Every
template can now be translated into multiple languages. Users decide in which
language they wish to receive their mail.

v2.4 drops mail template management from vpsAdmin web UI. Mail templates are now
to be managed by a new command line utility `vpsadmin-mail-templates`. Templates
are saved as text files on disk and uploaded to the API using this utility.

## Upgrade instructions

Standard upgrade process followed by optional configuration.

### Set original mail template language
Before v2.4, mail templates used an unspecified language. After upgrade, the
original templates are marked as English translations. 

If, for example, the templates were written in Czech, add the Czech language and
mark template translations accordingly:

[[!format sql """
INSERT INTO `languages` (`code`, `label`) VALUES ('cs', 'ÄŒesky');
UPDATE `mail_template_translations` SET `language_id` = LAST_INSERT_ID();
"""]]

### Set users' default language
By default, all users will have English set as their language. It can be
changed either through API or directly using SQL. First, create a new language
as shown above and then assign it to users.

[[!format sql """
UPDATE `members` SET `language_id` = <language-id>;
"""]]

### vpsAdmin Requests
If vpsAdmin requests are used, additional SQL query needs to be executed, as
requests are not a part of the API.

[[!format sql """
ALTER TABLE `members_changes` ADD `m_language` VARCHAR(5) NOT NULL AFTER `m_currency`;
"""]]
