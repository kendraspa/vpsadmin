# Release notes
Version 2.8.0 primarily features a new plugin for outage reporting. Outages can
be reported by admins from the web UI or the API. vpsAdmin knows what VPS are
(in)directly affected and can notify users via e-mail. It also allows admins to
post update on progress. Each outage is now assigned a type, i.e. how it affects
your VPS. It can be one of the following options:

 - tbd: to be determined; we're still investigating what's gone wrong
 - restart: the VPS will see it as a clean restart
 - reset: the VPS will see it as a hard reset
 - network: issues with connectivity, DDoS and so on
 - performance: temporary decreased performance
 - maintenance: VPS is running, can't be controlled from vpsAdmin
