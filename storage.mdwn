vpsAdmin has a very flexible storage system that takes care of VPS disks,
backups, NAS and more. The storage system is built on top of ZFS.

# The concept
The basic element of the storage system is a dataset (which is indeed a ZFS
dataset). A dataset can be present at multiple storage pools. Storage pools
are created on nodes, be it a hypervisor or a storage.

_Dataset in pool_ refers to one dataset being stored on a storage pool.

Datasets can have snapshots, which can be also present at multiple storage
pools where the dataset is.

## Layouts
Storage pools have assigned roles which determine their layout. There are three
layouts: _hypervisor_, _backup_ and _primary_.

### Hypervisor
Every first-level dataset in a pool is a private area for a VPS.

### Backup
Datasets here are backups of _hypervisor_ or _primary_ pools and the datasets
are branched. Branching is required because of the rollback operation, which
would without branches destroy all snapshots newer then the one rollbacking to.

See [[branching]] for more information.

### Primary
Primary layout is used when the data's primary location is on this pool.
vpsAdmin uses this role for NAS, but it can really be anything.

## Operations
The storage is fully transaction-based. Following operations are defined:

 - [[Create]]
 - [[Destroy]]
 - [[Set]]
 - [[Snapshot]]
 - [[Transfer]]
 - [[Rollback]]
 - [[Rotate]]

## Repeatable tasks
Very often it is needed to run operations regularily, e.g. snapshot and transfer
every day to a backup server. The storage uses vpsAdmin's task scheduler for that.

## Failure resistance
The storage uses transaction confirmations.

# Usage
Create a pool on a hypervisor node:

	$ vpsadminctl pool create -- --node 1 --name vz --filesystem vz/private
	
Create a pool on a backup server for VPS backups:

	$ vpsadminctl pool create -- --node 5 --name backups --filesystem storage/backup/vps
