# Frontend
There are two frontends as of now:

 - Web console embedded in vpsAdmin-webui, built on top of the client-side of
   ShellInABox
 - Console in CLI of vpsadmin-client

# Console router

Its purpose is to route requests from clients to appropriate vpsadmind and
relay its reply to corresponding clients. Its interface for clients is using
HTTP.

The console router actually serves the page with web console as well. It is at
`/console/:veid` using `GET` method. It requires the `session` query parameter.
The page fetches additional JS libraries from the router and then continues
with the requests described below.

## Request from a client
The request must use HTTP method POST at `/console/:veid/feed`, content type
`application/x-www-form-urlenconded`. Accepted parameters in the request body
are:

 - `session` - token used for authentication purposes
 - `keys` - raw data to be sent to the console, optional
 - `width`, `height` - the size of client's terminal, optional

The session token must be obtained through the vpsAdmin API
(`Vps.ConsoleToken.Create`).

## Reply to a client
The reply is formatted in JSON with the following structure:

	{
		"data": string; data outputted by the console encoded in base64,
		"session": true/false
	}

If the `session` is false, it means that the client can no longer access this
console. This happens after a period of inactivity.

# vpsAdmind backend
Console router sends messages to vpsAdmind via JSON over TCP. Each JSON
message must be separated with a new line. It is not a request/response
protocol, both peers might send data simultaneously. vpsAdmind does not
reply with JSON, it sends raw data from the console directly.

## Message from the console router

	{
		"keys": string; data encoded in base64; optional,
		"width": integer; width of the terminal; optional,
		"height": integer; height of the terminal; optional
	}

`width` and `height` must be sent together.

## Reply to the concole router
Raw data from the console, not encoded.

## Console wrapper
In order for the terminal resizing to work correctly, `vzctl console` must be
run in a pty. vpsAdmind therefore runs the console wrapper, which creates
a pty and runs `vzctl console` in it. The wrapper then sets the pty size and
notifies `vzctl console` using `SIGWINCH` about the change.

vpsAdmind communicates with the wrapper using a simple line-based text protocol
on wrapper's stdin, where as the wrapper prints raw data from the console
on stdout.

### Wrapper command protocol
Every message is in the form of `<C> <ARG>\n`, where `<C>` is a single character
identifying the command and `<ARG>` is an optional argument specific to that
command.

Commands:

 - `W <data>` - write `data` to the console, `data` is encoded in base64
 - `S <width> <height>` - change size of the pty and notify vzctl console
 - `Q` - detach `vzctl console` by sending `\r ESC .` sequence

## Operation

### Console router opens connection to vpsAdmind which in turn opens VPS console

## Known issues
Even with the console wrapper, resizing with `vzctl console` from upstream
does not work. It is because `vzctl` checks terminal size on `fd 0`, which
represents stdin. However, the wrapper's pipe is connected to the stdin, so that
it may send data to it, which makes the check fail. For this reason, vpsAdmin
requires a patched version of `vzctl` which checks the terminal size on `fd 1` -
stdout.
